## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Graphviz dot files that I use in my presentations for lectures and posters. These files are designed to create clear and informative graphs that help convey complex information in an accessible way.

## Usage

To generate the graphs from the dot files, you will need to have Graphviz installed on your system. You can download and install Graphviz from here.

Once Graphviz is installed, you can generate the graphs using the following command:

```sh
dot -Tpng -O filename.dot
```

Replace `filename.dot` with the name of the dot file you want to convert. This command will produce a PNG image of the graph.

## Examples

Here are some examples of the graphs generated from the dot files in this repository:

1. **Example 1**: A flowchart illustrating a process.
   !Flowchart

2. **Example 2**: A network diagram showing connections between nodes.
   !Network Diagram

3. **Example 3**: A hierarchical tree representing organizational structure.
   !Hierarchical Tree

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any dot files that you think would be a valuable addition to this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure to include a description of the graph and an example image if possible.
